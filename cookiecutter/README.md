# Cookiecutter for files generation

[Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) templates for generating files I use frequently.

### Quickstart

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet:

```bash
pip install -U cookiecutter
```

Generate files:

```bash
cookiecutter-file
```

Create a new files template:

```bash
cookiecutter-file-template
```
